!!!!!! POLISH !!!!!!


(Done) Change the weapon system so that it has multiple weapons that uses different ammos' like bullets rockets grenades.

(Gone with Projectiles that exists in the game only active when fired, maybe add object pooling(no need) for them?) Think of a way to impelemnt weapons ie: raycast for hitscans, projectile ( either particle or object) etc.

Destructible terrain (maybe voxels?)
